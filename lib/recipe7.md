As a user
So that I can keep track of my music listening
I want to add tracks I've listened to and see a list of them.

Music library class with the functions to add and see a list of songs

# 2. Design the Function Signature

class MusicLibrary():
    def __init__():
        list of songs

    def add(name and the artist)
        adds a dictionary of name and artist to list

    def show_list():
        returns the list of songs added

# 3. Create Examples as Tests

def test_add():
    add a song and artist pair, prove its in the dictionary

def test_show():
    add several items, prove the show function returns all of them.

# 4. Implement the Behaviour
